# Automating Invoice Data Extraction with Flora

In the modern business landscape, processing invoices efficiently is critical for maintaining healthy cash flow and compliance. Yet many organizations still struggle with manual data entry, leading to delayed payments, accounting errors, and wasted resources. Flora transforms this challenge into an opportunity for automation and accuracy.

## The Challenge

Traditional invoice processing faces several critical issues:

- **Data Entry Burden**: Finance teams spend countless hours manually typing invoice data
- **Costly Errors**: Manual entry leads to mistakes in payment amounts, dates, and vendor details
- **Processing Delays**: Slow processing creates payment bottlenecks and strains vendor relationships
- **Inconsistent Formats**: Vendors use different invoice formats, making standardization difficult
- **Compliance Risks**: Manual processes increase the risk of missing important audit trails

## The Solution: Flora API

Flora's intelligent document processing API automates invoice data extraction with remarkable accuracy, turning hours of manual work into seconds of automated processing.

### How It Works

1. **Define Your Schema**: Create a structured format for the data you need
2. **Submit Invoices**: Send invoice documents (PDF, image, or URL) to Flora's API
3. **Get Structured Data**: Receive clean, standardized data ready for your systems

Let's see this in action with a real invoice example.

### Step 1: Define Your Schema

First, specify the structure of data you want to extract using the `/v1/schemas` endpoint:

```json Invoice Schema [expandable]
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "invoice_number": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Unique identifier for the invoice"
    },
    "invoice_date": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Date the invoice was issued"
    },
    "due_date": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Payment due date"
    },
    "from": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "company": { "type": "string" },
        "address": { "type": "string" },
        "email": { "type": "string" }
      }
    },
    "to": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "company": { "type": "string" },
        "address": { "type": "string" },
        "email": { "type": "string" }
      }
    },
    "items": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "item": { "type": "string" },
          "quantity": { "type": "number" },
          "unit_price": { "type": "number" },
          "total": { "type": "number" }
        }
      }
    },
    "subtotal": { "type": "number" },
    "tax": { "type": "number" },
    "total_amount_due": { "type": "number" }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Submit and Extract

Send the invoice to Flora's API using the `/v1/extract` endpoint and receive structured data in return:

```json Invoice Extracted Data [expandable]
{
  "invoice_number": "#MON-178",
  "invoice_date": "07/04/2025",
  "due_date": "07/04/2025",
  "from": {
    "company": "Wayne Enterprises",
    "address": "Wayne Tower DC Universe, Gotham 8490",
    "email": "bruce@wayneenterprises.com"
  },
  "to": {
    "company": "Lexcorp Incorporated",
    "address": "New Troy, Metropolis. Gotham, DC Universe 37293",
    "email": "lex@luthorcorp.com"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "item": "Armoured Truck",
      "quantity": 35,
      "unit_price": 150410,
      "total": 5264350
    },
    {
      "item": "Kryptonite",
      "quantity": 250,
      "unit_price": 3433,
      "total": 858250
    }
  ],
  "subtotal": 6125940,
  "tax": 21,
  "total_amount_due": 6125961
}
```
